# Pneuma

Pneuma is the breath of life animating the platform via Kubernetes — orchestrating dynamic, self-healing, and scalable services atop the Logos foundation. Where Corpus gives form, Pneuma gives life, transforming infrastructure into workload environments capable of receiving and running application teams.

- **GKE clusters**: Multi-zone Kubernetes clusters with node auto-provisioning
- **Istio service mesh**: Traffic management, mTLS, and observability
- **cert-manager**: Automated TLS certificate provisioning via Let's Encrypt
- **OPA Gatekeeper**: Policy enforcement for Kubernetes resources
- **Datadog Operator**: Cluster-level monitoring and log collection

Pneuma consumes Corpus networking and Logos team data to create fully operational Kubernetes environments.
